# Plan2Track
Java and C# project I made as part of the OOP course in my 2nd year of the Bachelor in Software Development at HELMo

Keep the json directory outside of the root folders of the projects to make them work.

The Java application creates plannings and assigns the tasks to users and then exports the plannings to JSON files.
The C# application authenticates the user and reads and updates the tasks that have been assigned to that user.
